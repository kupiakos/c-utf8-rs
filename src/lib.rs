//! Operations on [UTF-8]-encoded [C strings][c_str].
//!
//! The [`CUtf8`] and [`CUtf8Buf`] types are guaranteed to be:
//!
//! - [Nul (Ã˜) terminated C strings][c_str] in order to more safely ensure that
//!   C APIs only access memory that is properly owned.
//!
//! - Encoded as valid [UTF-8], allowing for passing around native Rust [`str`]
//!   strings with ease.
//!
//! # Usage
//!
//! This crate is available [on crates.io](https://crates.io/crates/c_utf8) and
//! can be used by adding the following to your project's
//! [`Cargo.toml`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/manifest.html):
//!
//! ```toml
//! [dependencies]
//! c_utf8 = "0.1"
//! ```
//!
//! and this to your crate root (`lib.rs` or `main.rs`):
//!
//! ```
//! #[macro_use] // enables c_utf8! macro
//! extern crate c_utf8;
//! # fn main() {}
//! ```
//!
//! # Examples
//!
//! A [`CUtf8`] slice can be created via the [`c_utf8!`](macro.c_utf8.html)
//! macro, which ensures it will _always_ end with a trailing 0 byte:
//!
//! ```
//! # #[macro_use] extern crate c_utf8;
//! use c_utf8::CUtf8;
//!
//! static MESSAGE: &CUtf8 = c_utf8!("Heyo!");
//!
//! fn main() {
//!     let bytes = [72, 101, 121, 111, 33, 0];
//!     assert_eq!(MESSAGE.as_bytes_with_nul(), &bytes);
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! # Donate
//!
//! This project is made freely available (as in free beer), but unfortunately
//! not all beer is free! So, if you would like to buy me a beer (or coffee or
//! *more*), then consider supporting my work that's benefited your project
//! and thousands of others.

/// Creates a [`&'static CUtf8`](struct.CUtf8.html) from a native Rust [`str`]
/// string literal, making it much easier to work with C APIs that are strict
/// about encoding input as UTF-8.
///
/// # Usage
///
/// Although the input string can have a 0 byte, it is **highly recommended** to
/// not have one. This is because C APIs will only work with the memory up to
/// the first 0 byte. In the future, it will be very likely be a **hard error**
/// to have a 0 byte within the string literal.
///
/// # Examples
///
/// The resulting string will _always_ end with a 0 byte:
///
/// ```
/// #[macro_use]
/// extern crate c_utf8;
///
/// fn main() {
///     let string = c_utf8!("Hello!");
///     let bytes  = [72, 101, 108, 108, 111, 33, 0];
///
///     assert_eq!(string.as_bytes_with_nul(), &bytes);
/// }
/// ```
///
/// The macro can even be evaluated within a constant expression. This allows
/// for having instances of types with `&'static CUtf8` fields.
///
/// ```
/// # #[macro_use] extern crate c_utf8; use c_utf8::CUtf8; fn main() {
